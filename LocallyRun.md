To run a PHP application locally on your machine, you typically follow these steps:

1. **Install PHP**: If you haven't already, you need to install PHP on your computer. You can download PHP from the official PHP website (https://www.php.net/downloads). Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

2. **Set up a local server**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt window.
   - Navigate to the directory where your PHP files are located.
   - Run the following command to start a local server:
     ```
     php -S localhost:8000
     ```
   - This command starts a PHP built-in web server on your machine, listening on port 8000. You can specify a different port if needed.

3. **Access your application**:
   - Open a web browser.
   - Navigate to http://localhost:8000 (or whichever port you specified in the previous step).
   - You should see your PHP application running locally in the web browser.

4. **Interact with your application**: You can interact with your PHP application just like you would with any web application. Click links, fill out forms, and navigate between pages to test its functionality.

5. **Stop the local server**:
   - To stop the PHP built-in web server, go back to the terminal or command prompt where it's running.
   - Press `Ctrl + C` to stop the server.
